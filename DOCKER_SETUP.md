# Docker Setup Complete ✅

## Container Architecture

The application has been successfully containerized with the following services:

### Services
1. **nginx** (Reverse Proxy)
   - Routes all incoming requests
   - Port: 5001 (external) → 80 (internal)
   - Health check: `http://localhost:5001/health`

2. **frontend** (Nginx Static Server)
   - Serves HTML/CSS/JS files
   - Port: 80 (internal only, accessed via reverse proxy)
   - Location: `/` routes here from reverse proxy

3. **backend** (Flask API)
   - Handles all business logic and API requests
   - Port: 5000 (internal only, accessed via reverse proxy)
   - Location: `/api/*` routes here from reverse proxy

4. **data** (Volume)
   - Persistent SQLite database storage
   - Mounted at: `./data:/app/data`

### Network
- All containers communicate via `inventory-network` bridge network
- Only the nginx container exposes ports externally

## Verified Working ✅

### Container Status
```
✅ inventory-backend    - Running (healthy)
✅ inventory-frontend   - Running
✅ inventory-nginx      - Running (healthy)
```

### Endpoint Tests
```
✅ http://localhost:5001/health        - Returns "healthy"
✅ http://localhost:5001/api/products  - Returns [] (API working)
✅ http://localhost:5001/              - Serves frontend HTML
```

### Log Status
All containers showing clean startup logs:
- ✅ Backend Flask server running on 0.0.0.0:5000
- ✅ Frontend nginx workers started (12 processes)
- ✅ Reverse proxy nginx workers started (12 processes)

## Access Application

**URL**: http://localhost:5001

## Docker Commands

### View Status
```bash
docker-compose ps
```

### View Logs
```bash
# All containers
docker-compose logs -f

# Specific service
docker-compose logs -f backend
docker-compose logs -f frontend
docker-compose logs -f nginx
```

### Restart Services
```bash
# All services
docker-compose restart

# Specific service
docker-compose restart backend
```

### Stop All
```bash
docker-compose down
```

### Rebuild
```bash
docker-compose down
docker-compose build --no-cache
docker-compose up -d
```

## Database Location
SQLite database is persisted at:
- **Host**: `./data/inventory.db`
- **Container**: `/app/data/inventory.db`

## Notes
- Port 5001 was chosen as ports 80, 8080, and 3000 were already in use
- The `version` field in docker-compose.yml is obsolete but harmless
- Backend uses development Flask server (recommend gunicorn for production)
- All containers set to restart unless stopped
